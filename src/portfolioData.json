I was able to meet with the stakeholders of the company where we spent time talking about their needs which included rich multimedia showing detail in the sandblasted glass designs, showcase the business work that they continue to do in downtown Cleveland, and a place where people can express interest in a career.",

I used these to create a mock-up design in Photoshop. The client was happy with the design and gave me the ok to start building out in the browser.",
